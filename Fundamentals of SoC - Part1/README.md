## 3. BabySoC Overview

**BabySoC** is a **simplified, educational SoC** built to demonstrate core SoC concepts:

### Components:

* **VSDBabySoC / RVMYTH RISC-V CPU:** Lightweight, open-source processor core for understanding instruction flow and system behavior.

* **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL):**

  A **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** is a control system that generates a clock signal whose phase and frequency are locked to a reference clock. In SoC designs, PLLs are critical because they provide **stable, high-frequency clocks** from a lower-frequency source.

  **Key Points:**

  * Synchronizes internal clock signals to external references.
  * Enables CPU and peripherals to operate at high speeds.
  * Reduces clock jitter and ensures timing accuracy.
  * Used in BabySoC to maintain synchronization between CPU, DAC, and other blocks.
  * Typical PLL components: Phase Detector, Loop Filter, Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), and Frequency Divider.

  **Educational Relevance:**

  * Demonstrates the concept of clock multiplication and stabilization.
  * Shows how hardware ensures deterministic timing for digital circuits.
  * Provides hands-on insight into timing-critical designs in SoCs.

* **10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC):**

  A **DAC** converts digital binary signals from the CPU into corresponding analog voltages or currents. In SoCs, DACs are used to interface with the **analog world** â€” such as audio outputs, video signals, or sensor actuators.

  **Key Points:**

  * BabySoC uses a **10-bit DAC**, meaning it can output (2^{10} = 1024) distinct analog levels.
  * Converts digital values from CPU calculations into smooth analog waveforms.
  * Often paired with a **PLL** to generate precise analog signal timing for audio/video.
  * Useful for demonstrating waveform generation, audio playback, or other analog interfacing.

  **Educational Relevance:**

  * Provides a practical example of digital-to-analog conversion.
  * Bridges the gap between software (digital instructions) and hardware (analog output).
  * Introduces learners to resolution, quantization, and signal accuracy.
  * Enables experimentation with multimedia output using a simple SoC platform.

### Educational Benefits:

* Simplified design focuses on learning core concepts.
* Hands-on experimentation with CPU, PLL, and DAC.
* Demonstrates digital-to-analog interfacing and multimedia output.
* Provides a bridge to advanced RTL and physical design concepts.

## 4. Functional Modeling & Design Flow

SoC design typically proceeds through three stages:

<details>
<summary>Functional Modeling</summary>

* High-level simulation focusing on **what the system does**, not hardware specifics.
* In BabySoC: verifies CPU processing, DAC conversion, and PLL synchronization.
* Detects design errors early before hardware implementation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>RTL Design (Register-Transfer Level)</summary>

* Describes cycle-accurate hardware using **Verilog or VHDL**.
* Defines signals, control logic, and timing precisely.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Physical Design</summary>

* Maps RTL to transistors and chip layout.
* Optimizes for **power, performance, and area**.
* Prepares for **tapeout** in fabrication process (e.g., Sky130 technology).
